Java 17 support several litterals forms:
"hello"
Octal escape for byte size litteral such '\0'
Backslash escape '\b','\t'
Unicode escapes '\u7231'
String are immutable => any trasnformation on a text must create a new text variable

String can be shared since they are immutable. Compiler will find duplicates in code.
intern() method will put a String into the String pool even if it already exists.
Text block is processed before use: leading indentation is stripped indents like \r \r\n are replaced with \n.

"""hello""" is not a valid text block.

"""
    hello
    """ is correct and

"""
    hello""" also.

StringBuilder initial capacity can be changed. In this case, empty new slot will be filled with 0;

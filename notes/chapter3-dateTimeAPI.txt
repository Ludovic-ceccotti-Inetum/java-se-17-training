Absolute moment types (machine):

* Instant => point in the timeline in UTC

* ZonedDateTime => now at Brussels for example

Point of human reference (not absolute):

* LocalDate => friday 6th september 1990 somewhere

* LocalTime => 06:08:32 s

* LocalDateTime => friday 6th september 1990 0608:32

Elapsed time:

Duration => in nanosecond => absolute

Period => years,month, days => context dependent

Timezones => by offset, by id

/****/

Almost all types are immutable => operations create a new object, just like String

Most classes have factory or builder methods

/**** Timezones ****/
A timezone reprensents a moment in the time.

ZoneId includes region informations and rules about change while ZoneOffset is a subtype used for fixed offsets.

Timezone rules describe gaps (clock jumping forward) and overlaps (clock jumping backward)

The API provides conversion between local date and time with a timezone => ZonedDateTime
Between instant and ZonedDateTime
Between ZonedDateTime objects at different timezones

Comparing ZoneDateTime objects requires they have the same instant but also the same timezone.
